# Neko Atom UI #

Contrasted dark, focused and clean theme with a pinch of color for easy visual
grepping.

## Customization ##

The theme allows for editing of the primary color as well as the overlay used on
top of that color for context and menu items. It should work with every custom
dark syntax theme as well since default the theme overwrites their background and
gutter colors. You can disable this functionality with the "*Use Syntax*" option.

If you have made any changes you will either have to restart Atom or run the
window reload command.

## Workspace ##
